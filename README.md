# Traffic Light Simulator

# A web-based traffic light simulator built with React and Vite. This project models the sequence of a real-world traffic light system, with lights that change automatically after a set duration. It serves as a practical example for demonstrating the fundamental front-end concepts like component-based architecture, preventing multiple rendering and state management.
